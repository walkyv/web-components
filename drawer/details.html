            What if I get a date or clock error?
          </h3>
          <p>
            If the date or clock for your computer or other device is set
            incorrectly for your time zone, an error appears and you can't
            continue.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the defadlt time zone for computers with the Windows
            operating system is Pacific Time. If you manually change the clock
            or switch the time zone without immediately making sure the
            clock—automatically or manually—matches the time zone, the error
            appears.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Resolution:</strong>&nbsp;Switch to the correct time zone,
            if applicable. Make sure the date and time are correct for your
            time zone. If your clock is set manually—not from a network or
            Internet server, make sure it comes close to the time according to
            the World Clock. (You can search for the World Clock on the
            Internet.)
